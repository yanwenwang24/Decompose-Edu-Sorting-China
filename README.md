Replication package for "Understanding Trends in Marital Sorting by Education in China:  A Decomposition Approach"

## Abstract

Over the past decades, the patterns of educational sorting in marriage have changed dramatically in China, exhibiting a U-shaped curve for homogamy, an inverted U-shaped curve for hypergamy, and a consistently low prevalence of hypogamy. However, few studies have systematically examined why these changes occurred as they did. Using data from Chinaâ€™s Census, this study employs a decomposition approach to unpack the contributions of three driving forces: educational expansion, educational gradients in marriage rates, and assortative mating preferences. Results show that the initial decrease in homogamy among cohorts born before 1965 was driven entirely by educational expansion. For later birth cohorts, sustained educational expansion promoted homogamy and hypogamy while discouraging hypergamy. This influence outweighed the opposing effects of a steeper decline in marriage rates among highly educated women. Preferences for homogamy and against heterogamy, especially hypogamy, intensified. Combined, the three factors explained the rising homogamy, declining hypergamy, and stagnant hypogamy across later cohorts.
